It's an introspection again, an introspection which refers to our emotional beauty. So it's also one-pointed but one-pointed in introspection and not one-pointed towards the feeling that one gets. In order to get started,[4.0] Please put the attention on the best for a moment.[30.0] Now please repeat after me. May I be free from enmity? May I be free from enmity?[2.0] Now here the introspection is like this, that we find out whether we have any hate, aggression, dislike, feelings of being an enemy, or feelings of having enemies within. Whether we've had them, whether they still arise.[2.0] and find out whether that is to our own well-being and others well-being and find out within ourselves how we determined to let go of that what's the best way, how we're going to do it[143.0] May I be free from hurtfulness.[2.0] May I be free from the fullness. Now here we enquire into ourselves whether we have in the past or are still sometimes searching other living beings. Now this thing is physical, emotional, both ways. And if we find any of that in ourselves and we could also be hurting ourselves, then is it beneficial? Do we want to eliminate it? How do we go about it? What is our best position within ourselves to not have hurtfulness? The opposite is harmlessness. How do we encourage and develop that?[116.0] May I be free from troubles of mind and body?[2.0] Now here we can introspect, inquire, are we having any troubles of mind or body? If we have troubles of the body, does it affect the mind? Does it get troubled? What can we do to keep the mind in an even and calm state, without being troubled by worry and fear, by hopes and desires, by anger and resistance? How do we keep it in a calm state where it has an underlying feeling of being at ease, not dis-ease?[108.0] May I be able to protect my own happiness.[2.0] May I be able to protect my own happiness? Now, this is an important introspection, investigation, what constitutes my own happiness. Am I dependent for my happiness on outside factors, on other people? Am I dependent on my senses or have I been able to develop an inner happiness which is independent?[2.0] And if I have any of that, how do I protect it? If I'm dependent, how can I protect the pen?[140.0] May all beings be free from enmity.[2.0] May all beings be free from any evil. Now having looked into ourselves and recognized the danger and the unrest that enmity creates, we wish the lack of it, the elimination of it for everyone else. And having found a way possibly of doing it for ourselves.[2.0] we may be able to share that with others. If not, then we have that sincere wish for others to recognize the same within themselves as we may have done.[59.0] May all beings be free from hurtfulness.[2.0] May all beings be free from hurtfulness. Now again here applies the same thing as I just said. And we can actually direct our thoughts towards beings whom we know, people whom we know, or people in general, or in a certain area, those who may be just being hurt or are hurting, or people who are hurting.[2.0] and have that very strong wish that they may recognize how detrimental it is to their own well-being because we have recognized that already, wishing everyone to see harmlessness to be the only way to live in peace with oneself and others.[70.0] May our beings be free from troubles of mind and body.[2.0] May all beings be free from the crowds of mind and body.[3.0] what we're wishing for ourselves, we wish for others. And if we can find the way of actualizing, making this wish actually true, then we could share that understanding. In any case, we can have that feeling of unity with other people and direct our thoughts again to those we know, to those we don't know, or anyone in particular, or many, wishing them to have that freedom.[74.0] May all beings be able to protect their own happiness.[2.0] May all beings be able to protect our happiness. You know, if we wish that for others, obviously we will not disturb other people's happiness. Whether we agree with their outlook or not, there's no bearing on that.[2.0] We have a distinct and sincere and deep-seated conviction that their happiness contributes to our own, because we are in this together. So what we wish for ourselves is the same that we wish for them."}

May I be free from enmity? May I be free from enmity? The first thing to do is to investigate whether one has enmity in one's heart sometimes, rarely, seldom or often. How it usually arises.[2.0] investigate whether it's a cause for happiness or unhappiness.[3.0] whether one tries to justify it.[4.0] Whether one is very keen to let go of it.[3.0] [2.0] And then,[2.0] Having investigated all that.[2.0] To look to see whether one knows how to let go.[3.0] Can I actually substitute? Am I willing to do that? Do I recognize the great advantage?[100.0] May I be free from hurtfulness? Again, we investigate whether we sometimes actually want to hurt other living beings, or whether it happens spontaneously. Then look for the reason, the cause.[3.0] Admit the unhappiness that oneself[2.0] Experiences[5.0] Look to see whether there's willingness to let go.[7.0] and whether there is a pathway to let go of it.[46.0] May I be free from troubles of mind and body? Can I be free from troubles of mind and body? Now here we can investigate whether we actually can be our own best friend.[3.0] Obviously the body, quite often, does not obey. But how about our mind?[2.0] Are we careful with it? Do we know that we can create happiness or unhappiness through our mind?[4.0] Do we often forget that that is so?[3.0] Do we know a way?[4.0] Where we can keep the mind at ease.[2.0] Calm and collected.[2.0] [83.0] May I be able to protect my own happiness? May I be able to protect my own happiness?

Have I found true inner happiness or am I looking? Where am I looking? If I have found anything at all, how do I protect it?[30.0] May all beings be free from enmity. May all beings be free from enmity. What we're doing now is to wish the same for others that we're wishing for ourselves. And if we have found a way to actualize it, we may be able to share that.[2.0] But again, one of the important aspects is that we don't separate ourselves from others.[3.0] But feel connected and together.[2.0] having the same difficulty and the same abilities to solve them.[44.0] May our beings be free from hurtfulness. One important aspect of that is that having found within ourselves that we do have that tendency, and often or seldom also exercise it, that this is part and parcel of the human and others have it too. Accepitiing it within ourselves, we can accepiti it within others.[2.0] Finding a way out of it ourselves, we realize that everyone wants to get out of it because it creates unhappiness. But often can't find the way.[2.0] It listens our judgmental attitudes.[48.0] May all beings be free from troubles of mind and body.[4.0] Having recognized our own problems, own troubles, it creates compassion for ourselves and others, recognizing that there is no living being that doesn't have troubles of mind or body or both at some time or another.[2.0] So again we feel connected and together and compassionate. Can we actually arouse that feeling of togetherness? Arouse the feeling of compassion.[59.0] May all beings be able to protect their own happiness. May all beings be able to protect their own happiness. What we wish for ourselves, we wish for others. And it also behoves us to know that just as we like to, protect our happiness, others do too, so it's not up to us to disturb them, even if we are of different opinions.[13.0] If we have found a true way to happiness within ourselves, again we may be able to share it.[7.0] It may help us to create a feeling[2.0] helpfulness of generosity within us."}

Allow yourself to fully melt into those pleasant sensations.[2.0] And now notice if those sensations want to move or spread, allowing attention to be fluid and flexible as it rests on these sensations, as you melt into these sensations, and just allowing your experience to flow without any effort, using the parameters of your intention.[28.0] Notice that the effortlessness of this melting and this resting naturally multiplies the sense of pleasure in the body.[4.0] And notice that[2.0] pleasure and effortlessness both increase each other.[2.0] Very easily. Very gently.[2.0] as you melt more and more into those pleasant sensations.[3.0] allowing your attention to move, expand, contract naturally.[151.0] And we'll end here, but feel free to stay in this space for as long as you like."}

For maintaining continuity, it can help to have a consistent sense of some amount of change occurring, and sinking is one way to achieve that.[3.0] So to start the exercise you can just come into this moment and make any adjustments of your posture and Find a restful spot[2.0] Just let yourself gently turn inwards.[2.0] And you can just start with a couple of deep breaths if you'd like.[5.0] And you might try taking two breaths into the nose and then one exhale like[28.0] And then you might just ask yourself What is there in an experience that I can enjoy right now?[6.0] And just see if you can let a gentle sense of enjoyment or a smile come up.[8.0] And once you've noticed just a soft sense of enjoyment, it doesn't have to be anything large, but just a pleasant sensation.[2.0] We're going to try a couple of different ways of sinking into that sensation.[7.0] So you might ask yourself again[2.0] What is there an experience that I can enjoy right now?[3.0] Let yourself find something enjoyable and then let yourself sink forward into that enjoyment.[2.0] Just like you're being gently pulled by a string forward into that experience.[2.0] just slowly and softly sinking forward into that enjoyable sensation.[2.0] going deeper and deeper into it, being more immersed in it.[19.0] Just notice how it feels to sink into that sensation and notice if it feels more natural to sink a little bit faster or to sink a little bit slower.[2.0] And when it feels like you can't think anymore, you can just let yourself relax and be at ease.[3.0] And then ask yourself again[2.0] What is there right now in experience that I can enjoy?[3.0] Just see if you can let us smile.[2.0] Come to your face.[3.0] and then sink into the center of that enjoyable experience.[7.0] just becoming more intimate and closer with that experience by sinking into the center of it.[2.0] Thinking forward, like you're being just gently pulled into the experience.[37.0] And when it feels like you can't think anymore, that's fine. No need to keep forcing it.[2.0] Let's be at ease.[7.0] And you can ask yourself again.[3.0] Is there something enjoyable in my experience right now?[2.0] And this time you can try sinking backwards into whatever you find that's enjoyable.[2.0] just like you're softly floating in water is gently supported as you sink backwards slowly and effortlessly into that feeling of enjoyment.[19.0] Just letting yourself continue to sink backwards.[4.0] just gently being pulled backwards into that enjoyable experience.[27.0] And if the thinking ever feels too effortful or agitating[2.0] No need to keep doing it in this moment.[2.0] Just meet that agitation or that sense of struggle with some ease.[9.0] And then when you're ready, being curious and interested and open.[2.0] and asking if there's something you can currently enjoy in your experience.[9.0] Just allowing whatever arises to arise.

{"system": "You are a meditation assistant who guides the user through a Jhana meditation", "instruction": "Guide a meditation for feeling connected and open-hearted", "output": "For this meditation, we'll start with a breathing progression to help us center our energy levels and transition into practice. We'll then spend a little bit of time connecting with gratitude before we move into our base practice and then let that grow subtler and subtler. We'll use what we are working on in the morning exercises towards the tail end of this practice.[5.0] You can start by just finding a position where you'll be able to sit, a position where you're comfortable, a position where the body can be at ease.[3.0] Notice if there are any parts of your body that feel constricted or that are tugging. And just let yourself make any small adjustments moving your feet so that you will be supported for this practice period.[5.0] The first breath that we will be doing is to help energize the system. We'll be breathing in and out through the nose, but we'll divide our in-breath into two parts. We'll first breathe into the stomach, then breathe into the chest, and then breathe out. So breathe into the stomach, continue breathing into the chest, and then breathe out.[8.0] Find a pacing that feels natural for you right now. If you're feeling a little bit tired or drowsy, you might try a little bit of a faster pace. And if you're feeling more worked up or agitated, you might try a slower pace.[17.0] Let yourself find a rhythm that feels natural, where you don't have to monitor it as much, and the breath can just naturally flow. So into the stomach, into the chest, and then out.[22.0] You can just let your breath return to normal now for a little bit. Not controlling it in any way, but just letting it breathe.[8.0] Next on your in breath, I want you to breathe into your stomach and then on your out breath, release into your chest.[2.0] So on your in breath, pull energy downwards and then on your out breath, release energy upwards.[20.0] And you can just try letting your breath slowly elongate. Breathing into the stomach and then releasing out through the chest.[27.0] just finding a rhythm and a flow that feels natural and smooth.[42.0] We're now going to reverse that order. So breathe into your chest and then on your out breast relax out into your stomach, letting energy move downwards.[15.0] So on your in-breath pulling energy up into your chest and then on your out-breath letting the energy drift down into your stomach.[24.0] Just letting your breath naturally elongate and find a natural pace.[29.0] Just letting the energy slowly come from your chest down into your stomach as you breathe.[22.0] And now I want you to just keep all of your breathing in your stomach So breathing in through your stomach and breathing out through your stomach Just letting your energy circulate there letting your awareness be there[32.0] Just feeling the breath move into your stomach and move out of your stomach.[2.0] Let's see if you can let that happen with a little bit less control, a little bit less force. Just be in tune with it.[32.0] And now allow the breath to just feel like it's in the whole body.[2.0] No need to direct it to any specific point.[2.0] But just when you take an in-breath, feel your whole body. And when you take an out-breath, feel your whole body.[9.0] On the in breath you might feel the body expand a little bit and on the out breath you can feel it relax[47.0] Now that we've used some breathing to let ourselves transition into the practice, I'm going to start orienting us towards gratitude.[2.0] I want you to start by seeing if you can feel gratitude for this practice period For taking a moment during your week to let yourself calm down Let yourself unwind[2.0] Give some gratitude for taking a moment to look after your well-being.[10.0] easen if today's been difficult or the practice so far has been difficult[2.0] And it might just be small but a sense of gratitude for just being here and for looking after yourself and for taking care of yourself.[26.0] Just a sense of gratitude for the effort you're putting in for all the work you've been doing this week and for all the time you've been spending taking care of yourself. Really making sure that you feel well.[18.0] I want you to see if you can connect with a sense of gratitude for all the people that have helped you feel well in your life.[2.0] for the people that have helped create the conditions for you to take care of yourself, for the people that have looked after you or helped you in some way.[4.0] to feel a sense of gratitude for others and how they've shown you love and shown you care and supported you.[28.0] It can be people who have supported you very closely and intimately Or people who have done something that didn't even know you[3.0] people who laid the foundation for you being here right now. Or might be artists or authors. Just a sense of deep gratitude for all of the different people that have helped support you in some way. The people that have helped grow the food that you eat. The people that have built the buildings that you operate in.[39.0] It's a deep sense of appreciation for all of the different people that have helped bring about where you are today.[27.0] and just connect with a sense of gratitude for everything that you've experienced.[2.0] A sense of gratitude for your own journey, your own path.[3.0] The times that have been joyous and wonderful and full of awe And also a sense of gratitude for maybe more of the difficult times And how those difficult times have maybe helped you They've helped you learn They've helped you change[3.0] That's the deep sense of gratitude for what your own journey has been like and how that journey has changed and how you have changed.[15.0] and see if you can just get in tune with a sense of gratitude.[3.0] for the basic human condition.[2.0] That's the sense of gratitude for being here.[2.0] in this moment and for how things continue to unfold.[3.0] Just a deep sense of appreciation.[2.0] for being here right now.[26.0] We will now start to transition into our standard practice.[2.0] So you can start just trying to connect with a soft smile.[3.0] However, that might be showing up here right now.[5.0] And as you find a smile, you can engage with it in whatever way feels natural.[7.0] Just letting yourself dance with your smile, be delighted by it, and have some fun with it.[5.0] And if you notice that there's any grasping, any holding, any agitation[3.0] Let's see if you can let that relax.[3.0] Let yourself expand.[2.0] and then come back to your smile and playing with your smile.[19.0] And as you're playing with your smile, just letting yourself take the next step that is right for you.[3.0] with the background sense of the current condition.[3.0] and taking the next step, the next engagement, the next movement. That feels right.[4.0] that she was in tune with the current state of the mind and the current state of the body.[35.0] And if you notice that there's agitation or it feels like you're trying to force anything Then you can just relax That's the next step that you need[2.0] and let yourself expand if you feel contracted or if you feel small. Just let yourself be in tune with a sense of spaciousness.[5.0] And then maybe see if you can come back to your smile come back to something fun tune into something nice and pleasurable[28.0] Just letting yourself continually dance with a smile.[36.0] And if it ever feels like you need to add in a little bit more relaxation Then that could be the next step that you take[45.0] and instead of following an exact scripiti or an exact playbook[2.0] Just let yourself take the next step that you need right now.[3.0] It might be important to connect with a little bit of pleasure, to read up your smile, to feel that joy.[2.0] You might have a lot of joy present and so you just want to play with it Think into it Share it[2.0] You might feel a little agitated or a little restless[2.0] And so it's important to relax a little bit.[2.0] Or you might feel a little constricted or closed off.[2.0] until you let yourself open up.[4.0] But just letting yourself take what you need, the next step that you need.[82.0] Just noticing how each step impacts you.[2.0] If it ever feels like you get agitated, that's no problem at all. Just finding the next step that feels right.[49.0] And sometimes just coming back to your smile I can show you continue to drop a little bit of positivity a little bit of joy a little bit of playfulness back in[38.0] and see if you can just let the process flow a little bit[2.0] Just letting one step naturally flow into the next.[63.0] just finding a natural flow of movement.[3.0] where you're continually connected.[16.0] You can feel like you're entering into a river.[2.0] or a ball rolling down a ramp.[3.0] Just a slight incline or slant that you are riding.[109.0] You can start to let yourself gently come out of the practice period.[4.0] Now need to rush.[3.0] If you're feeling nice, you can even keep sitting.[2.0] But here is where my guidance will drop off."}

And just leave that area so that it won't disturb you throughout the meditation.[8.0] And next bring awareness to your ankles and your feet.[2.0] Just noticing how that area feels.[3.0] See if there might be anything that might bother you there[2.0] And if so, make any adjustment that might be helpful.[9.0] And then let yourself relax that area.[6.0] And you now can bring awareness to your entire set of legs and just feel your legs Feeling forming a base for your body[5.0] And just let that whole area relax and spread out.[7.0] And now you can bring awareness[3.0] to your glutes[2.0] Just let that area relax and spread out.[2.0] And notice if there's any subtle holding that you can let go of there.[3.0] and use that awareness of your root.[2.0] to then help find vertical alignment in your upper body.[2.0] So you might sway forward and backward a little bit side to side or around in a circle.[2.0] And then just use that to slowly like a pendulum coming to a halt[3.0] find some nice vertical alignment.[7.0] And you might let your obliques relax now.[5.0] Just letting your low back and abdomen come into alignment.[16.0] And on your next in-breath you can bring your shoulders up to your ears[2.0] And then on your out breath let them drift down[2.0] and into place.[4.0] With space from your ears[3.0] And you might try and just let your chest open up[7.0] And you can now bring awareness back to the vertical nature of your posture[3.0] and just makes any small, subtle or sensitive adjustments.[2.0] to bring that verticality back in alignment.[14.0] And you can now bring your awareness to where your neck meets your skull.[2.0] And just notice if there's any sense of construction in that area.[2.0] And then slightly, ever so slightly, tuck your chin.[2.0] Bring your head back a little bit.[5.0] I notice the impact that that has.[12.0] And you can now bring awareness to your jaw.[3.0] And let that part of you relax[9.0] and bring awareness to your eyeballs.[6.0] And let that part of you relax[4.0] and bring awareness to the back of your head.[3.0] and let that part of you relax.[12.0] And just take a moment now to feel the whole body[2.0] and the alignment of the whole body.[5.0] and make any small adjustments.[2.0] to ease any sense of construction or disturbance.[13.0] It might be relaxing the best.[17.0] It might be relaxing the pelvis.[11.0] It might be relaxing the sides of your torso or your chest.[17.0] And just know that you can keep letting this alignment and posture unfold as we get deeper into the meditation.[2.0] Not needing to stay perfectly still.[2.0] but just gently, and tenderly, allowing yourself to find more subtlety in your alignment.[9.0] And now that we've set up the posture[3.0] We can just bring a soft smile to our face.[7.0] Not needing to force any emotion to come with it.[3.0] but just a slight intention towards enjoyment.[2.0] and using the intention of smiling to cue that up.[7.0] Just planting a small seed that we can let continue to grow over the course of this meditation.[6.0] by gently inclining ourselves towards our smile.[2.0] towards how we enjoy our experience when we are smiling.[15.0] I'm just being curious about what flavor of enjoyment might be here for us right now.[27.0] And if you notice a sense of disturbance or struggle or agitation[2.0] You might let yourself gently relax[3.0] Let out a sigh.[3.0] Let yourself know that everything's okay.[35.0] And you might slowly try and put that smile in your heart.[4.0] and feel the different flavor of enjoyment that comes.[2.0] I'm putting that smile in our heart.[9.0] the sense of loveliness and tenderness[2.0] In gentleness and beauty.[48.0] Just staying with[2.0] that sense of deep connection.[2.0] and love at all heart.[3.0] That almost effortless quality[2.0] That is just there in our heart when we connect with it.[43.0] And now we're gonna take that lovely feeling that we're feeling in our heart and Start radiating radiating that out[2.0] So just take that feeling and start letting it shine to the left of you.[3.0] Just gently, softly, and slowly letting that feeling move from your heart to the left.[3.0] You can just let this process happen gently[2.0] But just working to have a continuous sense.[2.0] of love shining to the left.[12.0] [5.0] And if you ever lose track of the love shining to the left, just let yourself relax.[2.0] Come back to the feeling in your heart.

{"system": "You are a meditation assistant who guides the user through a Jhana meditation", "instruction": "Give loving-kindness and compassion meditation guidance", "output": "In this short meditation exercise, we're going to be exploring developing sensitivity or depitih with saying a couple of different mantras that are supposed to invoke feelings. This exercise is going to have us work to really be in tune with our feelings at a more intimate level.[2.0] So to start you can just let yourself gently transition into the meditation[3.0] Just being gentle and tender and having a lot of care with yourself as you let yourself unwind. As you let yourself feel at ease.[9.0] Just noticing how you feel in this moment. And knowing that however you feel right now, that's okay. That's what's present. That's what you're working with.[19.0] We're gonna start by saying a set of four mantras And we're just gonna say these verbal mantras internally to ourselves[2.0] The mantras are gonna be May I be safe[2.0] May I live a life with love.[2.0] May I be at ease.[2.0] and may I be happy.[5.0] May I be safe.[3.0] May I live a life in love.[3.0] May I be at ease.[2.0] May I be happy.[3.0] And as we say these four different phases, really trying to tune into the different emotion that each of them evokes.[2.0] May I be safe? Just a feeling of safety, a feeling of security, a feeling of protectiveness.[5.0] May I live a life in love.[2.0] a feeling of love and connection of compassion of relationship[2.0] [2.0] May I be at ease.[2.0] Just a sense of calm.[2.0] Just a sense of being in the right place[3.0] It's the sense of not having a lot to do.[4.0] May I be happy.[2.0] Just a sense of joy, a smile on your face, a sense of giddiness or delight.[4.0] And just keep[2.0] cycling those phrases one or two more times and just really try and feel into the different emotion that they're trying to evoke and be sensitive and in tune with the feeling that each mantra is asking you to feel.[53.0] And it can be helpful to let the time in between each phrase lengthen as you're really tuning into just a direct emotion.[3.0] May I be safe.[3.0] And let's feel safety.[12.0] [3.0] May I live a life in love.[6.0] I just deeply feel moved by love.[18.0] May I be at ease.[4.0] And just tune into a deep sense of calm[20.0] May I be happy.[2.0] And just feel a smile on your face. Just a radiant joyous.[29.0] [4.0] And as you get deeper in tune with the sensitivity of these mantras and the different feelings that they evoke, it can be helpful to just simplify the mantras. So rather than saying the whole phrase, this next time through, we'll just say one word to evoke the feeling.[3.0] Safety.[13.0] Love.[22.0] ease[14.0] happiness[2.0] And this one we say each of those words[2.0] Focusing less on the word and more on what the word is pointing at and the emotion that the word is pointing at.[3.0] And you can cycle through a few times saying the words to yourself[57.0] Safety.[5.0] Love.[5.0] is[2.0] happiness[9.0] And as we become more familiar with these feelings and how to evoke them within ourselves, we can become even more intimate, even more sensitive, even more subtle by evoking the feeling without saying anything verbally.[2.0] So for this next round, try and evoke each of these feelings of safety, love, ease, and happiness without even needing to say the word.[3.0] but instead just directly tuning into the feeling.[74.0] And just notice how it feels to just directly evoke the feeling without even saying a word.[4.0] What feels different about that? Does it feel a little bit more subtle or intimate or direct?[3.0] And just notice how without saying the words, maybe the feelings meld together a little bit more. There's less of an exact distinction between safety and love and these.[2.0] and happiness.[6.0] And we can just run through these feelings a couple more times. And I can just say the words. And you can just allow yourself to move through the feelings.[3.0] Safety.[5.0] Love.[12.0] happiness[2.0] and eat.[11.0] Safety, love, ease, and happiness."}

It has no limitations.[2.0] that drops full of love can go fine-bind.[21.0] I think of some difficult people.[3.0] Either difficult in your own life or difficult because their actions seem to be harmful.[2.0] That the fountain of love being infinite goes everywhere.[2.0] And so you fill their hearts too with that clear and pure water.[2.0] and each drop.[2.0] brings the warmth of love to their hearts.[2.0] And that is the only way to overcome hate and dislike.[60.0] We look at that fountain of love in our hearts and let it rise higher and higher. Get bigger and bigger so that it can reach out to more and more people.[2.0] and it goes far beyond the limitations of our bodies and our minds.[2.0] reaches out everywhere to fill people's hearts with the drops of love, which accumulate so that their whole hearts feel nourished.[34.0] and we let the drops from that fountain of love reach out and nourish[2.0] all the animals that we can think of.[3.0] birds[2.0] in fact these[3.0] cats, dogs, cows, or coons.[2.0] Any animal you can think of.[3.0] Dear[7.0] and the fish[2.0] in the streams, in the ocean.[7.0] The fountain of love from your heart is unlimited. It can go everywhere and nourish everything that it touches with purity, with love, with clarity, with love.[3.0] And so we let it also drop each water drop on nature around us.[4.0] The nourishment of that water of love is the greatest that we can bestow.[13.0] that that fountain of love in your heart grows so large that you can actually feel that it lets drops of love reach out to the whole of this planet.[3.0] all the living beings, all of nature, the earth, the water, the sky, everything that belongs to this planet. A fountain of love in your heart is unlimited and it can become so large that it can go everywhere.[20.0] Now put your attention back on yourself.[5.0] unless you feel the purity.[3.0] and the warmth of love from that fountain in your heart.[4.0] You're filled with that.[2.0] From head to toe.[2.0] surrounded by it.[3.0] and the joy that it gives.[3.0] is the most important aspect of your whole inner life that you're now experiencing.[17.0] May people everywhere find the fountain of love in their own hearts."}
{"system": "You are a meditation assistant who guides the user through a Jhana meditation", "instruction": "Assist me in a meditation for cultivating compassion towards others", "output": "For this short exercise, we are going to practice tuning into a deeper way of observing our experience. To noticing more subtlety in our emotional state and to seeing what might be behind the emotions that we are feeling.[4.0] To start you can just let yourself be at ease, find some stillness, and just let your experience settle.[4.0] Let any activity start to slowly wind down.[2.0] and let yourself feel your body and feel this moment.[4.0] It might be helpful to take a couple of deep breaths.[4.0] It might be comfortable. It might be helpful to become a little bit more comfortable.[11.0] Just let your mind feel at ease.[2.0] And if you can maybe bring a little smile to your face[2.0] Enjoy that you're taking a moment for yourself, that you're taking a moment to care for yourself.[3.0] and just connect with that sense of well-being that you want for yourself.[6.0] To start this exercise easery once in a while. I'm just gonna briefly ask you to notice what emotion you're feeling[6.0] Any emotion that you might be feeling is fine, but just take a moment to notice your emotional state.[13.0] And if it's helpful, you might just use one word to label your emotional state.[16.0] And if it's feeling really hard to come up with any specific emotion You might just try labeling what your energy feels like right now Are you lower energy or are you higher energy?[2.0] And you can kind of use that as a guide for discerning what emotion you might be feeling.[22.0] And similar to the exercise that we did the other day, I'll come back in every once in a while and just ask you what emotion are you feeling now?[3.0] And you can notice if that emotion has changed at all Of it's helpful. You might just notice if your energy has changed at all[31.0] What emotion are you feeling in this moment?[39.0] What emotion are you feeling in this moment?[24.0] And now I'm going to ask us to observe a slightly subtler and deeper level. So after asking you what emotion you are feeling, I'm going to ask you how are you relating to the fact that you are feeling that emotion.[2.0] So if you're feeling agitation, how are you feeling about the fact that you're feeling agitation? Are you feeling frustrated? Or maybe adverse? Or maybe you're feeling happy and You're feeling excited that you're feeling happy So just asking you to probe a little bit deeper into how you are relating to what you're feeling[14.0] So for me right now, I notice that there's a little bit of curiosity or excitement. And then as I say that, there's a little bit of nervousness behind that. Maybe something worried that that'll go away.[4.0] So ask yourself, what am I feeling right now?[3.0] And how am I relating to what I'm feeling right now?[27.0] When I asked myself that question just now, I noticed that I was feeling a little bit relaxed. And there was a sense of relief that I was feeling relaxed.[7.0] [2.0] [4.0] So what are you feeling? What emotion are you feeling in this moment?[8.0] And how are you relating to the emotion that you're currently feeling?[44.0] So what are you feeling in this moment right now?[5.0] And how are you relating to what you're feeling? And you don't need to necessarily label it. You can just allow one emotion to come up and then allow another emotion to come up.[26.0] And we're now going to try to go one link deeper So the next time I ask you I'm gonna ask How are you relating to the way that you're relating to the emotion?[2.0] This can be a little bit tricky to get this to work, so be patient with yourself and give yourself time in between asking and responding.[5.0] So how are you feeling right now?[9.0] And how are you relating?[2.0] To how you're feeling right now[8.0] And then how are you relating to the way that you're relating to that emotion?[8.0] So for me, I felt a little bit of peace and Then a little bit of agitation Worrying that that piece might go away and Then I felt a little silly about the fact that I was feeling that agitation[5.0] And I just found each of those emotions and each of those things come up[7.0] [8.0] So we can try that again.[2.0] What are you feeling in this moment?[7.0] How are you relating?[2.0] To what you're feeling?[11.0] And then lastly, how are you relating to the way that you're relating?[10.0] For me there, I was feeling a little bit of connection or love. And then I felt at ease that my heart was open. And then I just felt some openness at the way that I was responding. An openness to being in tune with all these aspects of myself.[6.0] So let's try that one more time and just really give space[2.0] to allow yourself to respond in any way.[11.0] How are you feeling in this moment?[6.0] How are you relating to the way that you're feeling right now?[7.0] And how are you relating to the way that you're relating to emotion?[8.0] And as we bring this exercise to a close, just take a moment to notice how much depitih there is to our feeling. And how subtly and quickly there might be responses to experience that we aren't even aware of. And that there's a possibility for us to keep probing into deeper and deeper levels of our response."}

And then we will do some relaxation and cultivating of enjoyment together, working to move ourselves to states of deeper depitih and more subtlety. To start, you can just let yourself find a natural resting spot, it might be lying down on the ground, it might be sitting in a chair.[2.0] But find a spot where you'll be comfortable and where you'll be at ease and where you won't be distracted by any nagging pains.[6.0] And you can just tune in to the sense of ease you might already be feeling.[2.0] I'm just taking a moment out of your busy day to just stop and Be in tune with your body Be in tune with your heart and be in tune with your mind[3.0] [8.0] And there might be a small sense of enjoyment that's already here[3.0] And just let a smile, a soft smile, an easy smile, a relaxed smile. Come to your face.[14.0] Just letting yourself be completely at ease and be here in this moment. Dropping behind whatever has happened already today or might happen in the future.[2.0] [6.0] And you can come into this moment even more by noticing the sensations of your body Noticing where it might be touching the chair or the ground[2.0] noticing the sensations of the skin, touching your clothing[2.0] feeling the breath move in and out of your body.[4.0] just starting to feel what grounded and present.[14.0] [11.0] And we can softly say to ourselves, I forgive myself for not understanding.[4.0] And just allow whatever emotional impact that has on us to take place.[4.0] It might be small. It might be a small softening. Or it might make us tense up.[3.0] But just notice how we're feeling and how we're responding to the idea of forgiving ourselves.[4.0] [3.0] Notice how we're responding to the idea that we might have made mistakes.[2.0] to the idea that things might not have been exactly what we wanted them to be.[8.0] that things don't always work out exactly as we planned.[3.0] And you can just say to yourself again, I forgive myself for not understanding.[13.0] And rather than focusing too much on the actual words that you're saying, just connect with that emotional tone.[4.0] The idea of letting the past be the past.[3.0] the idea of not being able to change whatever happened.[5.0] Just connect with that feeling.[8.0] the feeling of forgiveness.[7.0] You might say softly.[2.0] I forgive myself[19.0] [5.0] [5.0] I forgive myself.[3.0] [6.0] you[2.0] And just keep tuning into that feeling of forgiveness.[9.0] [4.0] And it might be easier to say, I forgive this situation.[6.0] I forgive this situation for any harm, any unpleasantness, or any disturbance that it caused.[23.0] [5.0] I forgive this situation.[3.0] Just keep really focusing on the emotional tone that that sentence evokes. The emotional tone of forgiveness.[4.0] The cathartic you might feel the relief[2.0] accepitiance. A sense of unburdening or taking off a weight that you might have been carrying around.[5.0] There might be all these little subtle ways of beating yourself up, wanting something to be slightly different, having incredibly high expectations for yourself.[6.0] And let's see if you can tune in to how it might feel.[2.0] Don't let that go.[19.0] [8.0] I forgive this situation.[6.0] [2.0] you[5.0] And you now might even simplify the phrase and just say forgiveness.[3.0] Just saying the simple word, notice the impact that that has on you. And see if you can tune into the feeling, the felt tone of forgiveness.[4.0] I've accepitiance[2.0] of an openness[3.0] of connection.[4.0] just recognizing sometimes we do things that aren't exactly what we want and sometimes others do things that might cause us some pain and that this complicated situation waits unclear exactly what is needed.[4.0] and see what it might feel like to just say that's okay.[3.0] Whatever happened happened.[3.0] And I can just be here now.[4.0] and feel forgiveness.[15.0] you[2.0] you[11.0] [4.0] Just tune into that sense of relief.[3.0] And we can slowly let that sense of relief and unburdening[2.0] turn into a forward-looking sense of gratitude.[4.0] a sense of gratitude that we have many more moments in front of us.[4.0] I think there's gratitude that if we want to make amends, if we want something to be different, we have that opportunity.[3.0] A sense of gratitude knowing that in the future things could be different.[4.0] That's just because something occurred in our past. It doesn't necessarily mean it'll appear that way in the future.[3.0] And just tune into that sense of gratitude, of openness, of forward-looking excitement.[2.0] [2.0] [5.0] And just notice how that feeling of gratitude shows up for you.[21.0] Just be in tune with what gratitude feels like.[2.0] feeling connected, feeling open, feeling thankful and appreciative.[5.0] It's just a deep fundamental sense of opportunity in front of you.[2.0] [19.0] And you can connect that sense of gratitude with the sense of forgiveness, knowing that from all of these previous moments you've learned from them that they were an important part of who you are.[3.0] And just feel gratitude for actually having those experiences.[2.0] and being able to see them for what they are.[3.0] you[20.0] Just a real sense of deep meaning and appreciation from your past and the ways that it has shaped you and the different turns that it's taken and how that's brought you to where you are now.[2.0] [2.0] [2.0] [3.0][2.0] [5.0] And now with every outbreath that you take, I want you to see if you can tune into a sense of relaxation.[2.0] A sense of being at ease.[2.0] Some tranquility.[2.0] some softness and some peace.[3.0] Just an easy and every outburst[4.0] Letting yourself grow a little softer.[3.0] a little bit calmer Just letting yourself relax[3.0] [6.0] It doesn't have to be a big movement. It can just be the tiniest sense.[5.0] because letting yourself soften and be open.[8.0] [11.0] Know that you set aside this time to be here. There's nothing else you have to do.[3.0] And with each out breath, just letting yourself get a little bit more relaxed.[9.0] you[3.0] you[2.0] you[2.0] you[2.0] you[4.0] Just continuing to experience some of the heaviness go away, starting to feel lighter, more at ease.[3.0] Just allowing yourself to open up to unfurl.[10.0] you[2.0] I just experienced a deep sense of peace in this moment.[10.0] you[9.0] And now when you're in breath, you can also start tuning into Just some enjoyment just enjoying that feeling of peace[2.0] enjoying that feeling of being at ease. And it doesn't have to be anything large.[2.0] But just see if on your in-breath[2.0] You can enjoy this moment.[9.0] and on each in-breath cultivating a little bit more sense of fun sense of playfulness[2.0] Just letting a smile show up on your face if it wants to be there.[33.0] Just with each and every in-breath, tuning into that sense of just enjoying this experience.[4.0] [6.0] [16.0] [10.0] And then we can allow both that sense of enjoyment and that sense of ease to be happening at the same time. So just on your in-breath, feel fun, feel happiness, feel excitement, and then on your out-breath, you can just let any sense of effort, any sense of agitation, any sense of disturbance go and just relax.[2.0] And then on your next in-breath feel a little bit more sense of excitement or curiosity or playfulness and Then on the out-breath just tuning into tranquility And just letting those two things kind of go in a loop on every in-breath maybe just some happiness and And on every out-breath just some relaxation[9.0] [13.0] [34.0] [11.0] You can just let these movements become a little bit smaller, a little bit more subtle, a little bit more sensitive. Not feeling the need to force them to take any form or to find any specific feeling, but just allowing them to show up authentically for what you are feeling in this moment.[37.0] [27.0] [13.0] Just letting yourself move to a deeper and deeper state. A subtler state. A state where you're more sensitive. Where you're more in tune.[2.0] Just allowing yourself to feel this happiness, to feel enjoyment, to be really enjoying yourself.[3.0] And then just letting yourself be at ease, be relaxed, not needing to go anywhere or do anything.[12.0] [18.0] [26.0] And we can slow down the tempo even a little bit more now So one full breath cycle is just feeling a sense of enjoyment[2.0] So both the in-breath, just enjoying yourself and the out-breath, feeling happy.[3.0] And then the next breath is feeling relaxed.[2.0] So both the in-breath, just a sense of peace and tranquility, and then the out-breath, just a sense of openness.[3.0] And no need to get this exactly perfect, but just letting it draw out a little bit, connecting with enjoyment for a more extended period of time, and then ease and relaxation for a more extended period of time, while still alternating back and forth between them.[71.0] [22.0] [5.0] [9.0] [6.0] [20.0] And you can really let any sense of needing to match your movements with the breath or needing to feel anything in specific drop away now[2.0] And just let yourself almost effortlessly glide with whatever you're feeling.[2.0] Knowing that if it ever feels too forced, too effortful, if you feel agitated, then just let yourself completely relax. Know that you don't need to force it at all. You don't need to make anything in particular occur. You can just tune into that sense of ease.[5.0] And then see if you can tune into a little bit of fun[4.0] [2.0] [3.0] [9.0] Just making this experience as playful, as joyous, as spontaneous as you can.[23.0] [10.0] [4.0] you[13.0] Just seeing if there's a smile available for you right now. And just letting a soft, easy smile be there on your face. And maybe be in your heart.[4.0] Just letting yourself be deeply moved and deeply in tune and deeply in harmony with your experience.[5.0] [7.0] [4.0] [4.0] And then just letting yourself relax[5.0] Just feel your body being at ease. Feel your mind being at ease. Feel your heart being at ease.[13.0] [13.0] Just really allowing yourself.[2.0] to feel peace and to feel that peace in your whole being.[17.0] you[35.0] And notice how when you're at ease, it's easier to just enjoy experience.[10.0] Just see if there's a smile, a sense of happiness, maybe a sense of delight or giddiness, present for you right now.[6.0] My guidance is gonna drop away for the next 10 minutes or so, but just keep letting yourself move back and forth between ease and enjoyment.[2.0] Whenever anything feels hard or agitated or effortful, just let yourself relax.[2.0] And when it feels natural and open, let yourself feel enjoyment and happiness and maybe even bliss and see the ways these two things are supportive of each other.[2.0] And I'll bring us out of the meditation by striking the bell three times.[bell][bell][bell]"}

You can find a spot for that person too.[10.0] And of course you want to invite everyone who is near you to come to the lake of your heart.[10.0] and everyone here at the retreat center.[11.0] You can invite all the neighbors.[7.0] In fact, this lake goes on and on. You can invite everyone in Bavaria.[11.0] The lake of your heart is huge. There's room enough for everybody in your country to come enjoy the warm, clear water of the lake of your heart.[20.0] The lake of your heart just goes on and on and on. easeryone on this planet could take the day off and come enjoy themselves in the lake of your heart.[2.0] Probably do the world a whole lot of good.[45.0] Now put your attention back on yourself, hanging out in the lake of your heart, surrounded by the people you're closest to, enjoying the warm, clear water in this magnificent setting.[7.0] May all beings everywhere be happy."}
{"system": "You are a meditation assistant who guides the user through a Jhana meditation", "instruction": "Give me a meditation for cultivating goodness and peace", "output": "Now we'll go to an energy body, whole body one, we'll do it as a guided meditation. Okay, just to give you a few ideas of what you can play with.[20.0] [11.0] Remember, take that time to...[2.0] Play with your posture.[7.0] You know sometimes when you're still getting used to all this and working with the energy body towards Samadhi even Micro adjustments in the posture make quite a big difference much more than you would think I could Say something about that. Maybe I'll say it another on another occasion, but[3.0] Take your time with the posture.[10.0] Just touching base with the sensations of contact, feet or the legs.[2.0] back with a backside on the chair cushion bench[16.0] feeling, sensing your posture.[2.0] sensing the uprightness.[2.0] the alertness expressed in the[5.0] sensing the resolve.[7.0] and at the same time sensing, feeling throughout the whole body space the openness, the recepitiivity.[2.0] the softness expressed in the poem.[8.0] ideal poise of the chitta manifesting, expressing in the posture.[6.0] the chitta will shape the posture.[2.0] the posture to a certain extent at least will shape the chitta.[2.0] mutual dependent arising.[4.0] and the whole body awareness, really again spreading that attention over the whole space of the body.[3.0] and even a little bit larger.[3.0] Now this attention will shrink so many times you can't count in one session.[3.0] No problem, you just notice that, you open it up again, you fill that space with bright presence, a live sensitivity.[6.0] And here working directly with the energy body, what we're interested in within that space is the the texture of it, the vibration, the tone of it, the feel, the energy of it.[9.0] It shrinks, you keep coming back to that.[15.0] And when you feel ready, allowing, supporting, encouraging the breath to be the longest possible, comfortable breath.[2.0] So really not a strain, just as long as it's still comfortable.[3.0] which may be much longer than you think or that you're used to.[2.0] and really not a lot of air.[2.0] It's really quite a gentle, subtle breath, relatively subtle.[2.0] a long, slow, smooth breath in and out.[5.0] and alive to the whole body space, the whole energy body.[19.0] as we explored briefly yesterday, you can tune in if you like to the sense of the whole space, the whole energy body expanding and contracting and what that feels like throughout the whole space.[3.0] And, or, you could also pay attention, tune into, feel into the sense of the whole space being energized, feeling energized with the in-breath and the kind of relaxation or letting go with the out-breath throughout the whole space. These are the energies, qualities, feelings, tones.[2.0] vibrations if you like that you're tuning into, opening to.[12.0] Really let that long breath open up the body, open up the whole space.[27.0] and again and again opening up the attention, the awareness to the whole space.[43.0] Make sure your legs are breathing, are being breathed, your feet. You may not have anatomical images of feet or legs or head or whatever. That's fine, just let that go if they're not there and you don't need to bring them back. Or you may. But really the whole body is breathing, the whole body space is involved.[6.0] including the head, or where the head is, where the feet are, where the legs are, that region of the space, region of energy, region of vibration.[42.0] I'm going to do something a little bit different. We're going to take a little bit of a tour.[2.0] So, when you're ready,[2.0] Can you imagine the breath coming into the body, coming into the energy body space at a point, let's say a couple of inches,[2.0] to the side or maybe a little bit below as well the navel the belly button[5.0] So I don't... it's probably not that helpful to imagine the breath as a kind of vapor like you see on a cold day when you breathe out and a sort of water vapor and air and that sort of swirling gas thing. They're just... what we're really interested in is if I conceive of the breath coming in there and just imagine that, how does it affect the whole energy, the whole space, the whole tone of the whole body?[4.0] If you are visual and you want to experiment with a visual thing, you could imagine the breath as a kind of column of light or beam of light coming in there into the energy body. And how does it affect? How does it ripple out from there?[2.0] What do you notice when you imagine that?[3.0] whole body awareness.[5.0] But now we don't have to be wedded to the longest breath. So there's two things to play with here. What do you notice when you imagine the breath coming in there? And also, what kind of breath does the body want coming in there? Is it a really long breath? Is it a much shorter breath somewhere in between?[2.0] Is it a kind of fuller breath or a...[2.0] Very gentle soothing breath.[2.0] Don't be afraid to use your imagination to play.[2.0] What do you notice in the whole body space? And what kind of breath just feels best?[18.0] All very light, very playful.[26.0] What do you notice in the whole space?[3.0] It's energy, it's tones.[4.0] It's a feeling.[11.0] What kind of breath feels[14.0] And when you're ready, leaving that point there and coming, imagining the breath coming in at a similar point on the right hand side.[3.0] So about two inches from the navel doesn't have to be exact at all just somewhere around there that feels kind of[2.0] Maybe a little bit lower.[3.0] Whole body, whole energy body awareness, sensitive, bright.[5.0] sensitive to what the body wants.[2.0] What kind of breath it wants.[56.0] Construing the breath and construing the body is just energy. Both are energy.[2.0] imagining, sensing.[2.0] body and breath as energy.[4.0] and feeling that, noticing.[2.0] what it feels like and what feels good.[3.0] or as good as possible for right now.[21.0] whole body awareness really opening up that attention again and again to the whole space.[6.0] and opening up the whole body to the breath, to the breath energy.[13.0] when you're ready the same thing at a point perhaps in between so on the midline of the body perhaps a couple of inches or so down from the Belly button from the navel somewhere around there Doesn't have to be exact just what feels kind of right[7.0] Same playing, same experiment, same sensitivity and questions for the whole body, for the whole energy body.[73.0] Again, when you're ready, moving that point, the point at which we're construing, imagining, sensing the breath energy coming into the body, moving it up that midline to somewhere in the solar plexus area.[4.0] What does it feel? What do you notice in the whole space? With the in-breath, with the out-breath, construed, imagined, sensed?[91.0] So there's really not a right and wrong here. It might be you sense that whole space expanding, contracting, or energizing and relaxing. It might be that you notice certain currents through different parts of the body, and maybe different as you breathe in and out at different points.[5.0] Whatever it is.[8.0] that you find helpful to tune into, to feel into, to open to.[34.0] you're ready, just moving up a bit higher on that midline to the heart centre, somewhere on the midline around the level of the heart.[2.0] or a little higher even.[67.0] Feel really into one of these points right now. You don't have to necessarily move on just kind of Doing a bit of a tour And if you want So you can stay with whatever you want to explore for a while. It feels good[2.0] But if you want, you can move up now and the breath, imagine it, construe it, sense it, coming in the front of the throat.[2.0] So not down from the mouth but directly into the throat.[5.0] what ripples out then from that point.[2.0] through the whole energy body space.[6.0] nose ripples might even extend out of the body.[4.0] out of that space or they may circulate in the space or[2.0] No right or wrong.[104.0] you want to, you can.[3.0] Play with.[3.0] idea, the image, the sense of the breath coming in at the crown of the head, down into the body space from there.[7.0] Maybe your anatomy is clear, maybe it's really not clear or partially clear. It's not that important at this point.[8.0] What happens and what kind of breath does the body want?[2.0] when it comes in.[2.0] when it goes out there.[5.0] What does it feel?[24.0] The breath goes out, but we're paying attention to the space and how the breath going out feels or affects.[82.0] light[4.0] Open.[2.0] sensitive[42.0] And if you want, how about the breath energy coming in and out of the energy body, of the whole body space.[2.0] Either at there.[2.0] face of the neck somewhere around there or even[3.0] base of the skull or somewhere in between.[3.0] region there and just play.[5.0] breath coming in there, affect the front of the body[2.0] effect their legs the whole[3.0] What kind of breath?[15.0] What kind of breath supports a sense of well-being in that?[4.0] just as much as that is possible.[64.0] How about if you're already somewhere around the back of the heart, the back of the body, the breath energy.[4.0] Coming in, going out there.[55.0] be afraid to[4.0] or concern, am I imagining something? If you imagine it first and then feel it, great.[6.0] imagining certain currents or whatever.[2.0] It doesn't matter as long as the kinesthetic sense gets involved.[2.0] that sensitivity to the feeling, the tone, the energy.[55.0] And if you want to, if you feel ready,[2.0] about the breath energy coming in either at the sacrum or the tailbone or some place around there. Again along the midline.[6.0] Perhaps there are currents flowing down your legs.[6.0] as well as up the back.[6.0] at the same time radiating out from that point.[12.0] What kind of breath?[2.0] supports a sense of well-being, a feeling of well-being just as much as[102.0] And when you're ready, just...[3.0] staying with the whole space that[2.0] energy body awareness that expands over that whole area, the whole body.[3.0] letting the breath go and just being with that sense of that[4.0] Let the breath do whatever it wants to do[4.0] No need to pay any attention particularly to the breath. You might notice it of course anyway, but just being aware of the whole vibration texture feel energy tone of the[24.0] Coming out of the meditation[26.0] You get the idea?[2.0] Anything is possible here. There's no right or wrong, there's no order. You need to go in if you're moving around like this. You might find you want to stay at one point for a whole sitting, because that's the juicy point, or that's the point where it's easiest for you. It could be anywhere, you know. Anything is possible, experiment.[2.0] Sound okay? [2.0]You might have the breath coming up, you know, from the earth through your feet into the whole body. It might be from the middle of the body that it kind of expands out, you know, it's not even coming in from the outside, or from it might come in from 360 degrees, you know, there's there's no limit to what's possible here.[5.0] Make enough sense to experiment with, yeah? Did you have a question?"}

{"system": "You are a meditation assistant who guides the user through a Jhana meditation", "instruction": "Guide a gratitude and positivity meditation", "output": "In this meditation we're going to work on inquiry again and we're going to focus on the difference between two ways of doing inquiry. So one way we're focusing on the looking and then another way we're focusing on just listening. So in the looking we're contacting our sensory experience directly and feeling rather than thinking about or imagining, feeling into what's actually there. And this is an active process. We're trying to give as close as possible, as gently as possible, to sensory phenomena. So this is, for example, take a sound happening in your awareness right now. And in space, wherever the sound is happening, you're already in to move. You're already close to the experience of sound happening wherever it is.[3.0] There's another mode of inquiry in which we simply drop in a question and listen. We're not moving anywhere. We're not getting close to anything. We're waiting for answers.[3.0] So let's begin the meditation.[8.0] Connect with movements in your body.[6.0] Maybe your eyes are fluttering.[5.0] Maybe your breath is circulating in the space of your body.[13.0] And we're going to ask a question and actively look.[4.0] How is my experience in this moment?[15.0] In this very moment, what am I?[6.0] If you notice, thoughts. Oh, I'm a engineer. I'm just some dude. I'm a meditator. Look, can you find those things in one of your senses?[2.0] Does a meditator exist as a site in your experience right now?[4.0] Does a meditator exist as a sound in your experience right now? Look.[10.0] Does your meditator exist?[2.0] as a body sensation right now.[2.0] Look.[3.0] And you point to the body sensation that is meditating.[6.0] Find the body sensation that's meditating, like you're looking for a where's walled out.[17.0] Is this meditator that you think you are a thought?[10.0] And you notice you're probably not thinking the thought, I am meditating, I am meditating, I am meditating over and over while you're meditating.[4.0] What happens when you're not thinking about meditation? And yet you're still meditating.[11.0] And look again for what's happening right now[8.0] What is this?[29.0] I won't ask the question.[4.0] What's it like for me right now?[7.0] But thinking minds are something like I'm alright. Thanks for asking. How are you?[2.0] Set that aside and look.[2.0] What is it like to be you right now?[12.0] Notice there are some body sensations happening. Maybe you can find some emotional tone.[2.0] some thoughts floating around.[2.0] from sound.[19.0] Now let's focus on instead of looking for an answer, listening for an answer.[5.0] And we're going to drop in a question and just relax.[7.0] Task.[2.0] Is there anything I can stop struggling with in this moment?[10.0] and rest.[22.0] Ask Is there anything in this moment that my mind is tightening around and trying to grab[3.0] And can I let that go?[5.0] And rest.[25.0] now[2.0] What can I relax around right now in my experience?[5.0] And rest.[45.0] Is there anything in your experience right now you could embrace just a little more?[29.0] Ask, what even is tension?[6.0] What is tension made of?[10.0] And these inquiry questions, the answer, quite literally, does not matter.[3.0] In fact, if you get an answer, it's almost certainly not a useful one.[3.0] Inquiry, it's the looking, the listening, and the asking that matters.[20.0] Ask, is there anything in my experience that I'm pretending I could escape from in this moment?[5.0] And can I relax that imaginary struggle with what is?[14.0] Good.[3.0] These are all examples of inquiry questions you might ask to see if there's any relaxing in-to-experience and around experience that might be available to you. And if nothing shifts, something deep down does in the inquiry and eventually something might shift.[17.0] Is there anything in your experience that's kind of nice right now?[21.0] Notice the awareness that already permeates your core. A central line parallel to your spine running from your seat to the top of your head.[11.0] ask what's going on there[11.0] Maybe it feels like[2.0] This is made of jellyfish floating around.[3.0] Maybe it feels like the breath is moving in a circular current.[5.0] Maybe it's faint, vibratory, tingling, aliveness.[4.0] Maybe it's an emotion you know too well.[9.0] Maybe it's just space.[3.0] Peaceful, open space.[14.0] And you might notice that space has a lot of room for things like joy and appreciation and gratitude.[3.0] You might notice how many wonderful things that space has held for you over your life.[6.0] You might recall a time when the space just was joy.[4.0] Maybe one of your favorite memories.[7.0] And you might notice in your chest, what's going on there?[6.0] There are any warrants present?[9.0] Is there any soft, fleecy texture of comfort and coziness well enough?[11.0] Maybe there's just a patient called Expans there[3.0] Totally relaxed, totally open.[21.0] Stay present with the sensations and emotions and feelings.[3.0] alongside your core.[4.0] Is there anything you could appreciate right now? Just a little more?[4.0] Is there anything asking for your attention and appreciation?[6.0] Is there anything that wants a little love and awareness?[36.0] Notice how things are shifting.[2.0] There might be warmth expanding.[3.0] I might be tingles like[2.0] campaign bubbles or static electricity.[5.0] Stay with us, stay close to us.[10.0] There might be a caught me okay mess that you never thought to look at before[18.0] Notice the things feel...[2.0] neutral or unremarkable or everyday.[2.0] Ask yourself.[3.0] Are those just synonyms for peace and calm and open accepitiance?[15.0] That's it.[2.0] How alive is the kaleidoscope of sensations that makes up your experience of your body right now?[8.0] Notice how things are always flowing and changing, dancing, shimmering.[6.0] Stay close to that experience.[7.0] Notice if you want to check out and say you've looked, you know what's going on. Notice if you want to do something else, rather than stay with your experience.[62.0] I'll see you.[2.0] Is gratitude a thing in itself? Or is it a relationship to a thing?[3.0] And is there anything you can be more grateful for right now?[11.0] You let go.[2.0] of the idea that there's anything in your experience right now that isn't remarkable and mysterious.[2.0] and worthy of celebrating.[6.0] Where did all of your experience come from?[5.0] How is it even here?[14.0] Is there any gratitude already in your existence?[44.0] Now, bring your attention to the back of your body or your spine.[4.0] and you relax and fall back.[2.0] into that which is holding you.[53.0] Ask. How do you know you're having an experience right now?[2.0] and luck.[9.0] How do you know you're awake right now?[9.0] And are you doing that awakeness? Or is the awakeness just there for you?[9.0] Is this awakeness, this awareness holding your entire experience for you right now?[10.0] You let go into that.[15.0] you relax the idea that there's anything to do or that you're doing anything.[6.0] Outs are happening. Feelings are happening. Founds are happening.[8.0] Did you do anything about it?[14.0] Or can you relax into the already happening, effortless nature of your experience in this moment? You don't have to hold onto anything. You don't have to hold anything else.[14.0] What are you trying to hold up? What are you trying to hold on to?[5.0] Look.[6.0] Is that necessary? Can you let that go?[2.0] Can you relax?[19.0] Is there anything to enjoy about letting go?[4.0] You might feel[3.0] an open presence.[2.0] Ready for anything?[3.0] You enjoy that?[5.0] You might notice the center of space is open up.[2.0] Like opening a window on a hot stuffy summer afternoon.[16.0] Notice if awareness is refreshing or pleasant.[7.0] I appreciate that. Notice how that lands along your core.[26.0] and stay[2.0] with the emotional sensations happening in the line from your hips, your lower belly.[3.0] your solar plexus.[3.0] Your rib cage[4.0] center of your chest[8.0] your collarbone.[2.0] I'm sure that is how.[10.0] Notice all the movement going on in all of these places. Stay with those. What are they made of?[4.0] What's even doing all this feeling?[7.0] What's your throat?[12.0] Now, Mr. Head.[26.0] What's the most nourishing aspect of your experience right now?[5.0] I'm gonna say[30.0] When did that begin?[5.0] When did it show up to support you like that?[19.0] Notice if it's changing or moving. Maybe it disappeared.[2.0] Notice the sense of space that replaced it. And notice how that's pretty nice too.[34.0] And this[4.0] Is there any bracing against experience?[9.0] And we're just noticing.[19.0] Is there anything in our experience we feel a certain type of way about?[3.0] And feel into that feeling.[7.0] as close as possible to the sensation.[43.0] When did this moment begin?[2.0] And look.[12.0] Can you find the beginning to any particular feeling, any particular thought?[2.0] or this moment of consciousness as a whole.[30.0] I'm three connected with the breath.[4.0] When does an outbreath end?[5.0] You connect with the moment and out breath and be there for it.[54.0] You sense your breath cycling like a force of nature all by itself[2.0] Like the tides[2.0] like the cycles of them now.[3.0] When did the ocean begin?[9.0] Can you stick with your brow?[2.0] and feel into it if there's an answer in direct experience.[5.0] When did the tides of your breath begin?[12.0][4.0] Notice what happened.[6.0] notice whether your breath feels more animated, vibrant.[2.0] Or notice whether your mind jumped down and tried to provide a lot of answers.[5.0] And that's how your experience is different now.[3.0] And it was before we began the fin-cree.[7.0] What's here?[7.0] Are the thoughts about what's here the same as what's here?[8.0] are our thoughts about what's here and what's here. Just two different things that are both here.[4.0] And can you stay with all of them?[18.0] Stay with the crowd[4.0] And that's the ease.[3.0] Let go.[26.0] Notice how good it feels to breathe.[3.0] The body loves to breathe.[9.0] Connect with our basic desire.[4.0] for air and movement and oxygen being satisfied with every ingress.[16.0] or anything you can enjoy in that simple need getting fulfilled over and over and over.[60.0] Can you rest?[2.0] and the simple, relaxing, happiness of your experience right now.[22.0] Done.[2.0] I'll send the meditation there.[5.0] So there's a quality of ease that's always present.[2.0] And it lives in the simple fact that awareness and experience is already happening. You're not, when you're relaxing, doing the relax step, you're not making anything happen. You're simply stopping doing the thing that was preventing you from relaxing in the first place. And that takes a little practice at first and does feel like you're doing something. But you're just letting go of pretending that things in this moment could be different.[3.0] and inquiry is a way of working on a level that's more open and recepitiive. And personally, I have only experienced unexpected shifts in inquiry, so remain open for radical shifts to open when you drop in a question. So thanks for meditating with me."}

May I be free from enmity.[2.0] So the first thing to do with that is to have a look at oneself and see whether sometimes often or seldom, enmity arises in the heart. Negativity towards people, rejection, disliked, and disliked.[2.0] worry and fear, they all fall under that heading. See if that happens. And then the next step would be to ascertain whether those emotions bring happiness or unhappiness.[2.0] If they bring unhappiness, what can I do to change that?[4.0] If at this particular moment I don't know how to change it, have a look. Why does it arise? What's the reason?[2.0] You see the reason you will also see the remedy.[132.0] May I be free from hurtfulness.[2.0][4.0] Again, we'll have a look inside ourselves whether we sometimes or often or seldom hurt another living being. Now that includes physical but particularly emotional. And if we do find that this happens,[2.0] Ask why.[2.0] And the answer may be another question. Find the reasons.[2.0] and then see whether this is wholesome and useful or whether it would better be better if it was changed.[8.0] And it's important also to recognize how will I change that.[5.0] The determination to do so is only a first step.[2.0] The next step is how do I do that?[4.0] Can you use any of the things you've heard?[152.0] May I be free from troubles of mind and body?[5.0] Now again, we take a look and see whether we have it.[2.0] And if there are any troubles with the body, can we let go? Letting go with the mind.[6.0][7.0] letting go with the mind not to be troubled by the body. Do we have any troubles of the mind? What could we let go so that those troubles go?[2.0] Do we have enough friendship and love for ourselves to do the best thing for ourselves, not indulgence, just wisdom and real attention to our own well-being?[112.0] May I be able to protect my own happiness.[2.0][4.0] Now this is an important question. What is my own happiness?[2.0] If it depends upon outer conditions, depends upon people, and if so, does that produce anxiety and fear of loss?[2.0] What is my true happiness?[2.0] Can I actually find it within? Or do I know about it?[2.0] Can I fathom what it's like?[4.0] And if I can, what does it mean to protect it?[116.0] May all beings be free from enmity.[2.0] and now I'm being treated.[4.0] Having seen within ourselves that enmity is the cause of unhappiness, that we ourselves don't want to harbour it, we wish the same for everyone else. We see our likeness, our togetherness, and we realize that[2.0] Our own peace and joy needs to go together with our love and care for others.[3.0] If we have found a way to overcome enmity in our hearts,[2.0] We may be able to share it in any case our love and care for others[2.0] can come out.[96.0] May all beings be free from hurtfulness.[2.0][4.0] And again, have we realized that hurtfulness in ourselves is only hurtful to us and creates unhappiness around us.[2.0] We wish the lack of it for all beings and we let our hearts reach out to as many beings as possible.[3.0] wishing for them.[2.0] Peacefulness.[3.0] Enjoyfulness.[2.0] independent of auto condition.[4.0] just as we are trying to find within ourselves.[50.0] May all beings be free from troubles of mind and body.[2.0][7.0] This wish for others needs also to be based on the insight that there are no beings[2.0] human otherwise, that don't have troubles.[2.0] dukkha. It's part of existence.[3.0] And if we do wish ourselves another[2.0] that they may not have any dhuka, any trouble.[2.0] Then we wish them at the same time.[2.0] to tread the path.[2.0] To eliminate all the[2.0] And we wish that out of empathy.[6.0] Out of compassion.[2.0] with ourselves and others.[52.0] May all beings be able to protect their own happiness.[9.0] First of all, that...[2.0] tells us that we must never disrupt another being's happiness. Whatever they think it may be.[2.0] But also we wish for them happiness within independent of outer conditions. Just like we have tried to find in our own selves.[91.0] in order to start, we'll put the attention on the breath for just a few moments.[41.0] will think of our most beloved person.[5.0] the one[2.0] Which we can love without[2.0] Any restrictions.[3.0] where our heart is quite open.[3.0] and fully giving.[7.0] and we feel that and then transfer that same feeling we have for our most beloved person to ourselves.[6.0] No difference between the most beloved person and ourselves.[2.0] Still ourselves with that same feeling.[21.0] We'll put our attention on the person that's sitting near us.[4.0] And we give that person the gift of our heart, the exactly the same feeling that we have in our heart for our most beloved person. We make no difference between one and the other person. It's just the love that we would like to extend.[21.0] And you will think of a must beloved person once more.[2.0] and feel quite clearly what's in our heart. warmth and care embracing togetherness.[2.0] Oneness.[4.0] And now we'll think of our parents.[4.0] and we let exactly the same feeling reach out to their hearts.[80.0] And think of our most beloved person once more.[2.0] and experience the feeling we have for that person.[2.0] and then think of those people that are closest to us, that we live with.[4.0] and give the gift of our heart to each of them.[4.0] It's the same love that we have for our most beloved person.[3.0] without expecting anything in return.[42.0] We'll think of all our good friends.[4.0] and let our heart full of love reach out to each of them.[5.0] embracing them in the same way we embrace our most beloved person.[9.0] feeling our togetherness, our oneness, our care.[4.0] giving this gift without expecting any return.[42.0] We bring up the feeling for our most beloved person once more. Feel ourselves with it.[2.0] Have a heart expand with it.[2.0] and then reach out to the people we meet in our everyday life.[8.0] neighbors, people at work.[4.0] patience[3.0] Feels people.[4.0] anyone we can think of who's part of our daily life.[2.0] and our heart can reach out to all of them.[4.0] embracing them with the same love that we have for our most beloved Christian.[3.0] so that we can actually feel that the warmth of our heart increases and expands.[3.0] And we can[2.0] It's too beautiful.[5.0] Then love we fear.[2.0] to as many people as we meet.[45.0] I will think of somebody[2.0] Homebrew, maybe, angry at or dislike. Reject, or reject us.[4.0] Or, if there is no such person, somebody were quite indifferent too.[3.0] and feeling that.[3.0] loving and embracing feeling for our most beloved person.[2.0] We reach out to the difficult person and give the gift of our heart.[6.0] and we feel the release and relief that this brings to us.[41.0] We'll think of our most beloved person once more.[7.0] We have the feeling for that person.[3.0] At a most in our heart[2.0] and then we let it flow out of our heart.[2.0] The people near and far.[3.0] like a golden stream that can catch as many people.[2.0] is the strength of our heart to meet.[2.0] First of all those who are present here.[11.0] and all the people that are present in the place where you live.[2.0] We may have seen[2.0] or just assumed to be there. And then we let that golden stream of love flow further and further.[3.0] to wherever we know or assume that people can be found.[6.0] And we can feel our togetherness, our oneness.[2.0] embracing of our heart.[10.0] So that the love for most beloved person[2.0] becomes the quality of our heart.[45.0] And once more we'll think of our most beloved person and experience the feeling we have for that person.[3.0] and transfer the feeling to ourselves.[4.0] being filled with it, surrounded by it.[7.0] giving us a sense of protection and security.[47.0] May people everywhere learn to love each other."}

Look at it.[3.0] It fills your heart.[2.0] and you can love yourself because you carry that within.[10.0] and the love that you feel.[3.0] It's a nourishment for that seed to develop.[27.0] the wounds of your heart gives that beautiful seed within the necessary ground that it needs to grow.[13.0] And you can be joyful at seeing that this wonderful jewel exists in your heart.[8.0] Now put your attention on the person sitting near you.[2.0] in the same jewel, translucent, shining,[2.0] reflecting many colors.[2.0] of the greatest value lives in that person's heart.[2.0] and you can fill that person from head to toe with the warmth of love.[3.0] It's the only thing that you can do to help to make that seed into a beautiful flower.[31.0] and think of your parents whether they're still alive or not.[2.0] and see that beautiful seed of enlightenment in their hearts.[3.0] the most valuable jewel there is in this world, in the whole of the universe. And you can love them and care for them as a carriers of this beauty.[23.0] And now we think of those people who are nearest and dearest to us that we might be living with. And each one carries that same jewel, a seed of enlightenment within.[2.0] which illuminates the whole heart when we allow it to do so.[2.0] and our love and compassion and care and concern.[2.0] can fill the hearts of these people, to give them nourishment so that the seed can grow.[54.0] We think of our friends, acquaintances, relatives, anyone that comes to mind, anyone at all, that we would like to extend the warmth of our love and the care of our compassion to. We look into their hearts and see exactly what we have in our own, the jewel of the seed of enlightenment, and we can love them and embrace them.[2.0] And menifests are together in that way.[32.0] And we think of all the people whom we meet in our everyday life.[2.0] wherever they might be, wherever comes to mind are neighbors, people at work, people in the shops, in the offices.[2.0] on the road, in the cars.[3.0] Whoever it is whom we meet, whom we might talk to, or just see, and all of them carry that same beautiful jewel, the seed of enlightenment within. And it is easy to love them, to care for them, to manifest our togetherness, because we know that they have that which is of the greatest value, the same as we do.[2.0] So we extend the warmth of our heart to them.[2.0] and manifest the togetherness that we feel[3.0] and the care and help that our love can give them.[38.0] And now we think of a difficult person.[2.0] Anyone whom we have been angry at, have rejected.[2.0] Anyone who's been angry at us has rejected us.[2.0] or one or more people. And each one carries the same jewel, the seed of enlightenment within. In their hearts and only love, it's an nourishment that can make that seed grow and develop and become a beautiful flower.[3.0] And again we realize the togetherness with that person, the sameness, the non-separation.[2.0] and the warmth of our heart extends also to the difficult people.[27.0] And now we take a look at people everywhere.[2.0] Whatever comes to mind, those that are here, in this hall, everyone that's at Green Gorge, all the people in the surrounding houses, people in the cities, towns, on the land, all over the country.[2.0] There isn't one that doesn't have that same jewel in the heart.[3.0] And it's easy to love each person.[2.0] So feel connected.[7.0] to manifest the warmth and embrace[2.0] and to know that that's the only way we can live together in peace and develop the seed of enlightenment. Wherever we look, each heart has it.[2.0] It's of the greatest beauty.[2.0] and magnificent value.[12.0] and so our love can flow easily, everywhere, unimpeded.[33.0] And we put our attention back on ourselves.[2.0] and take a look into our heart.[2.0] And can we see that this wonderful jewel that we carry within[2.0] has become a little more shining.[2.0] is reflecting the decision colors.[2.0] takes pride of place in our heart.[4.0] And since we can love that jewel, we can fill ourselves from head to toe with the warmth of love.[4.0] and surround ourselves with the care of compassion.[6.0] can feel at ease and protected.[21.0] May people everywhere cultivate the seed of enlightenment in their own hearts.[7.0] Imagine that there is a sun shining in your heart.[2.0] Right?[3.0] and warming.[4.0] creating light.[2.0] warmth.[2.0] leaving nothing uncovered.[6.0] making the flowers and the seeds grow.[3.0] Your heart becomes a most beautiful garden with the sun shining on it.

Let the sun from your heart reach out to their hearts. Fill them with the warmth, the clear light.[2.0] The beautiful ceiling.[3.0] Give it to them as a gift from you.[46.0] Think of your nearest and dearest people, those that you might be living with. And because the sun is shining in your heart, you can give them the warmth and the light and the clarity, the beauty of your heart.[2.0] without expecting anything in return.[37.0] And now we'll think of our friends and acquaintances and relatives, anyone that comes to mind. Let them arise before your mind's eye, see them quite clearly, and see the sun in your heart, warming, shining, full of light.[2.0] clarity, beauty, and then let its rays reach out to these people's hearts, filling them with the greatest beauty we can give away.[2.0] the warmth of our heart.[49.0] And we think of those people whom we meet in our everyday life.[3.0] Anyone that comes to mind, neighbors, people at work,[2.0] on the street, in the shops, in the offices.[3.0] We see in the traffic[3.0] And the sun in our own heart makes it possible to give them all great warmth, beautiful rays of shining light.[2.0] to give them joy.[3.0] to manifest our togetherness, to make them aware.[2.0] that we have this heart's gift for them.[51.0] Think of a difficult person in your life, or several, or those people who you find difficult because you can't agree with their ideals or thoughts or actions.[2.0] And just as the sun shines on everybody alike, so the sun in your heart also shines on that difficult person or persons.[2.0] The rays from that sun in your heart warm set person's heart and you can let go of the difficulty and Embrace that person in the fullness of the warmth of your heart[2.0] Now open your heart as wide as possible and let the sun grow and grow in your heart, shining on people everywhere, bringing them the warmth and the light and the beauty of your heart. First, let it reach out.[2.0] and let its rays shine on the people here.[3.0] Then on everybody at Green Gorge.[4.0] And then we'll further field.[3.0] Let it shine wherever you can find people, either knowing them, having seen them, heard about them, or assuming them to be there.[5.0] The sun shines everywhere. It doesn't discriminate.[2.0] Let the sun in your heart do the same. Bring the warmth of your heart to people everywhere.[5.0] Mm.[8.0] Let it also shine on all the animals and insects.[2.0] that live with us.[3.0] All the ones you can think of flies grasshoppers cats mice rats raccoons[6.0] anything at all that you can think of that lives with us.[4.0] The warmth of your heart can embrace it all.[5.0] Let the sun of your heart shine on me.[2.0] The trees and the flowers.[2.0] Bushes.[2.0] the vegetables.[2.0] everything that surrounds us.[5.0] loving them.[3.0] helps for the togetherness with them.[3.0] not just spending a part and admiring them, but being part of them.[6.0] Let the warm rays from your heart reach out to the sky.[2.0] The clouds, the moon and the stars.[8.0] as far as the horizon and beyond.[7.0] Let the love from your heart include.[2.0] all the land and the oceans on this planet.[2.0] And as you do that, you will see living beings everywhere, in the water, in the air, fish, birds,[3.0] Go further and further afield, embrace it all, because the sun in your heart can shine everywhere.[2.0] bringing the warmth and the clarity and the light to all that we know.[15.0] And I'll put your attention back on yourself[2.0] and see the beautiful sun in your heart.[3.0] Philip warmth.[2.0] Touching you, feeling you, embracing you.[3.0] Feel the sense of well-being.[2.0] contentment and gratitude.[2.0] being protected by that.[2.0] Be made step-fast.[5.0] having a sense of a strong, solid foundation on which you can rest.[8.0] May people everywhere.[2.0] feel the warmth of the sun in their hearts.[11.0][5.0] In order to start, please put the attention on the breath for just a few moments.[28.0] Imagine that you have a beautiful bubbling fountain of clear and pure water in your heart where every drop that falls down is filled with love.[2.0] so that your heart becomes filled with love very quickly. And all the drops that come out of that wonderful fountain, a fountain of love, have shiny colors in them, because they are so pure and so clear that a rainbow can be mirrored in them.[2.0] and with that beauty the warmth of love also is coming into your heart and filling it completely.[14.0] And since your heart is already full of all these drops of love, you now fill the whole body from head to toe. We show it's beautiful, clear, and beautiful.[2.0] Water drops from the fountain of love.[18.0] Now let this fountain of love reach out to the person near its view and fill his or her heart with those drops that contain the warmth of love, are pure and clear, and fill that person's heart so that there's joy and recognition of the beauty of love.[21.0] And think of your parents, whether they're still alive or not, that fountain of love bubbling away in your heart is available to everyone. Let all the drops that you can gather[2.0] Reach out and fill their hearts.[4.0] The love that they feel brings joy to them.[22.0] And now let that fountain of love in your heart send its water drops each one full of love to the hearts of the people that you live with.[2.0] of those that are nearest and dearest to you.[2.0] without any expectation to get anything in return, as a pure gift from your heart to their hearts.[26.0] and the more those water drops you give away.[2.0] The better that fountain seems to function.[2.0] It reaches higher and wider and more water drops full of love seem to come out of it. So you reach out to the hearts of your friends, of your relatives, your acquaintances, and fill them all with the beauty of that clear and pure water that comes out of the fountain of love.[2.0] And you can see that they feel joy in your togetherness, in your care, in your gift.[22.0] Now look around for more people.[2.0] that can take part in the fountain of love that's bubbling in your heart.[3.0] that you can give the gift of love to.[3.0] those that you meet in your everyday life.[4.0] those that you see around here.[2.0] So is that you've heard about?[4.0] Those that you've known.[2.0] those that you assume are there. That fountain of love.[2.0] It's infinite. It has no limitations.[2.0] that drops full of love can go far and wide.[21.0] Now you think of some difficult people.[3.0] Either difficult in your own life or difficult because their actions seem to be harmful.[2.0] That the fountain of love being infinite goes everywhere.[2.0] And so you fill their hearts too with that clear and pure water.[2.0] and each drop.[2.0] brings the warmth of love to their hearts.[2.0] And that is the only way to overcome hate and dislike.[60.0] We look at that fountain of love in our hearts and let it rise higher and higher. Get bigger and bigger so that it can reach out to more and more people.[2.0] and it goes far beyond the limitations of our bodies and our minds.[2.0] reaches out everywhere to fill people's hearts with the drops of love, which accumulate so that their whole hearts feel nourished.[34.0] and we let the drops from that fountain of love reach out and nourish[2.0] all the animals that we can think of.[3.0] birds[2.0] infect these[3.0] cats, dogs, cows, or coons.[2.0] Any animal you can think of.[3.0] Dear[7.0] and the fish[2.0] in the streams, in the ocean.[7.0] A fountain of love from your heart is unlimited. It can go everywhere and nourish everything that it touches, with purity, with love, with clarity, with love.[3.0] And so we let it also drop each water drop on nature around us.[4.0] The nourishment of that water of love is the greatest that we can bestow.[13.0] Let that fountain of love in your heart grow so large that you can actually feel that it lets drops of love reach out to the whole of this planet.[3.0] All the living beings, all of nature, the earth, the water, the sky, everything that belongs to this planet. A fountain of love in your heart is unlimited and it can become so large that it can go everywhere.[20.0] Now put your attention back on yourself.[5.0] unless you feel the purity.[3.0] and the warmth of love from that fountain in your heart.[4.0] You're filled with that.[2.0] From head to toe.[2.0] surrounded by it.[3.0] and the joy that it gives.[3.0] is the most important aspect of your whole inner life that you're now experiencing.[17.0] May people everywhere find the fountain of love in their own hearts."}

But as we settle into the sitting experience, we can open our attention first to the experience of sitting the posture.[8.0] and notice the quality or state of mind.[2.0] Just simply what is your experience.[3.0] So we tune in to what is actually happening for us now.[9.0] In this willingness to be present with the actual reality of our experience, what's happening now? We can guard the mind as it receives input from any sense-store, seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching.[4.0] mental impressions, memories, mental patterns, habits, plans, thoughts.[4.0] So with mindfulness we not only know what is happening.[3.0] But we're aware of our response and when we're mindful that response is going to be of mindfulness.[2.0] Sometimes our mindfulness is a bit muddied, and so we have a chance to see some defilement creep in, and then we just deal with that.[9.0] Sometimes when we tune into our sensory experience and the mental response of it, what we notice are other wholesome states arising along with that mindfulness. Maybe faith might be strong.[5.0] Maybe understanding or enthusiasm might be strong. Maybe tranquility, joy.[3.0] or perhaps metta.[10.0] And so even when our intention is to focus in on a specific meditative object or meditative development, for example, metta.[5.0] easen then, we still protect the mind with mindfulness. We still notice what's actually happening right now.[5.0] We tune into our experience and bring wisdom to bear upon that.[2.0] And out of that clarity then, out of that balanced mind.[2.0] then we can pick up our meditation object.[3.0] Today I'll continue with the instructions for Metta.[12.0] finding some way of holding ourselves with this positive gentle and kind regard.[2.0] Generating good wishes for ourselves.[3.0] Notice how you do that.[20.0] Can you see yourself in a way that brings forth this natural sense to be happy and not suffer?[16.0] Sometimes highlighting our good qualities helps.[15.0] May I be safe, happy.[3.0] Healthy.[3.0] And at ease.[18.0] As you generate these good wishes, allow them to fill your entire experience, body, mind, consciousness.[2.0] a sense of being drenched or bathing in metta.[24.0] If there's a sense of pleasantness, that's fine.[2.0] Let that pleasantness occur. Our meditations don't all have to be grim and serious.[48.0] Just as we wish to be happy and not suffer, we know other beings share this very same wish. And so we might bring to mind other beings that are easy to hold in this field of metta and welcome them into our hearts, welcome them into this field of loving kindness.[9.0] They might be people that we call benefactors or dear friends, whoever you found fairly easy to generate loving-kindness.[11.0] Take a moment to think of that person in their best light.[9.0] Maybe seeing them in a happy moment, maybe seeing them engaged in a virtuous activity.[2.0] And with the thought of that person, offer your wishes of goodwill, with the phrases, or simply suffuse them, pervade them with this energy of loving-kindness.[88.0] One classic approach to the cultivation of living kindness is to systematically work through the categories of self, benefactor, dear friend, neutral beings, and difficult ones.[9.0] Some of you may wish to, at your own pace, continue with the specific categories, focusing on the specific images of each person, concentrating the mind by holding an image of the person while steadying the attention with this consistent inclination toward loving-kindness.[9.0] But this morning I want to introduce the use of groups as a prelude to all beings.[7.0] Sometimes when we focus on categories, we focus just on one person at a time. But life is vast.[7.0] And so there are a number of different approaches, of course, to this and everything. One of the traditional approaches divides classes of beings into males and females, for example.[4.0] into enlightened and unenlightened.[4.0] into those in the human realm and those in higher realms like heavenly realms or lower realms like hell realms or animal realms.[2.0] These are ways of using large group categories that when combined add up to all beings. So they give us a sense of a way to direct our attention. That's a little bit more specific than just a general concepiti, all beings.[8.0] You might want to play a bit with these categories once met to has arisen with yourself and Perhaps one other specific person Now you might think May all females[3.0] Be safe.[5.0] Be happy.[2.0] healthy and at ease.[7.0] and let your attention expand to recognize.[2.0] This component that is just arbitrarily defined as female.[2.0] In the human world, in the animal world.[4.0] among birds.[5.0] All life.[4.0] May all females be happy and well.[19.0] May all males[2.0] Be safe.[3.0] Happy, healthy, and at ease.[18.0] Throughout the world, the human world, the animal world.[3.0] The world of birds[21.0] Traditionally, these two categories, males and females, combined together, encompasses all beings. But if you want to add another category, that's fine too.[45.0] The next grouping is of unenlightened and enlightened. Obviously these two groups are not, probably not going to have the same number of beings in each. It can encompass all realms of existence.[2.0] the potential that there may be awakened beings and realms were not able to see.[2.0] or sense.[3.0] The probability that many animals, insects, fishes, birds, and their vast numbers may be in the unenlightened category as well. So this category can expand beyond human life.[5.0] So you might contemplate for a moment the unenlightened beings of the world, the worlds.[3.0] With the thought may they be happy and well.[16.0] and then the enlightened beings may they be happy and well.[30.0] So our loving kindness expands to all beings regardless of their degree of development.[4.0] Our loving kindness flows equally to those who suffer with greed, hate and delusion.[2.0] who have strong bents towards lust or cruelty.[2.0] or arrogant.[5.0] And our loving kindness flows also to those who have freed their minds from these defilements.[3.0] And their minds are utterly pure.[3.0] May they all be happy and well.[10.0] May our loving-kindness be unlimited, boundless.[58.0] And the next set of groupings traditionally is a grouping of three. The lower realms, the human realms and the heavenly realms.[9.0] In one way or other this is an attempiti to expand the loving-kindness so that it is absolutely fast and immeasurable.[4.0] even if we don't know the extent of alternative realms or other dimensions of existence.[4.0] Maybe the heart can be wide and open enough to wish any beings anywhere.[2.0] Well.[5.0] And so we contemplate beings in each realm of existence.[2.0] with the thoughts of loving-kindness, pervading those entire realms with good wishes.[4.0] May beings suffering in the lower realms, the hell realms, the realms of insects and animals.[5.0] May they find ease and safety.[7.0] May they be well.[26.0] To contemplate the human realm, you might have images of people around the world, all kinds of people.[2.0] Not only the individuals that you can picture their faces of.[4.0] But people from all kinds of cultures and of ages, colors and sizes.[7.0] Some who are wealthy, some who are poor.[2.0] Some who are educated, some who are illiterate.[2.0] People with different belief systems, different languages.[2.0] different social customs.[8.0] May all humans be safe, happy, healthy and well.[12.0] And with these thoughts of goodwill, we suffuse the entire human realm.[3.0] with loving-kindness.[52.0] And then similarly for celestial realms, for devas, for deities.[2.0] For any gods there may be, may they be happy and well.[44.0] allowing metta to pervade the all-encompassing world."}

I need not retain.[2.0] any of those feelings.[3.0] but you do not bring happiness.[5.0] We forgive the person we were who thought and said and did things we may not approve of and lovingly embrace that person that we are now.[37.0] May people everywhere.

{"system": "You are a meditation assistant who guides the user through a Jhana meditation", "instruction": "Guide a meditation for feeling connected and open-hearted", "output": "Okay, so for the guided meditation, I'm going to give you about 20 minutes to get concentrated.[2.0] And then I'm going to make some sounds.[2.0] And your job is to see, can you notice the Vedana of the sound itself? You probably will have thoughts about the sounds and so forth, and they'll produce Vedana as well, but can you get the ones for the sounds themselves? And the first sound I'll make is I'll ring the bell. That doesn't mean it's over. That means that's the first sound. And then I'll make some more sounds. And you can try and see, can you recognize the Vedana?[2.0] But it's the fade net goes really fast, so it's going to be helpful the more concentration you can generate.[1149.0] So could you notice the vagueness of the sounds?[2.0] Any comments?[3.0] on this.[25.0] So, yes.[5.0] Yeah, the reaction can be that, yeah, it's unpleasant enough that you respond with other parts of your body. I mean, the fingernails on the blackboard, the whole body responds to that.[4.0] And especially a startled when you're not expecting it your whole body jumps[3.0] That jump is downstream. There's the sound unpleasant. And then there's the, oh, come to alertness, right? This might be dangerous. And that's what the jump is, but that's downstream process.[2.0] In fact, it's triggered by the unpleasantness[14.0] So this is another insight practice.[2.0] What I would suggest is that you get very concentrated, very helpful if you can come out of a jhana, and then just open up your ears and listen, and just notice how you're reacting to each of the sounds.[2.0] Notice the sound jhana itself as different from the downstream reaction jhana.[2.0] and just get a sense of, yeah, okay, this is how I initially experience sensory input. After you begin to get a feel for the sounds, then I would say play with touch sensations. So everything from the touch of the breathing to the touch of sitting, anything that you can, any touch sensation you can feel. Just notice whether it's pleasant, unpleasant or neither.[2.0] After you've played with that, then try it with the food.[2.0] Food gives you so many vagueness.[2.0] And if you go for a walk you can try it with the smells. And then after you've really gotten a sense of, you know, alright, what this is like, then try sight as the last one. Because it's the most difficult, because we immediately run off into whatever it is we're seeing, as opposed to just the color.[3.0] So why this big deal about Vedana? Well, it seems they run our lives.[2.0] It's almost like we arrived here, somebody handed us an instruction manual, and we opened it up and it says, Seek pleasure, avoid pain, live forever. Because that's how we run our lives. And so we're running after the pleasant Vedana, and we're running away from the unpleasant Vedana. And that seems to be just basically what it's all about. And there's actually more to life than just pursuing pleasure and running from pain.[2.0] In fact, if you want to escape the dukkha, you've got to do more than that. This is what the Buddha is saying. Because if you're not careful, the vaidna leads you to craving and clinging for the pleasant stuff and craving for the absence of the unpleasant stuff. And all that craving. That's all.[2.0] lead to Tukka if you're not careful. So this is why the Buddha made it so important. It's really at that point when we can get in there after the Vedana and actually[2.0] change our reactions from not being craving and craving.[2.0] And we'll talk about that more when we talk about dependent[5.0] Questions?[28.0] Thank you for sitting.[10.0] Yeah, not only single-pointedly aware, but also able to see a somewhat bigger picture, including the Vedana.[2.0] So there was single-pointed focus, which helps you get not distracted. And then there's the ability to sit there at the ear door and watch a sound come in and then notice.[2.0] So having a quiet, calm mind enables you to see this very subtle thing because the Vedana They're pretty quick and they don't stick around long And most of the sensory input it's a very very brief Vedana that's happening So having a really calm quiet mind makes it possible[3.0] So, again, having a really calm, quiet mind when you're doing your meditation practice, get you out of your ego and get you much more into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can really get into a place where you can[2.0] at subtle levels.[9.0] Right. Thoughts, emotions and memories. It's the ego I would say is a collection of thoughts, emotions.[2.0] and then it starts responding to the environment that it finds itself in.[34.0] It's a reaction, really. Not even thinking. It's just instantaneous.[6.0] After the sensory input by science says one-tenth of a second.[2.0] Within one-tenth of a second we evaluate whether that sensory input is pleasant or unpleasant or needs to be.[7.0] There's the sensory feeling and then there's the mental activity of the vagna and then after the vagna there's the mental activity of perception. And the perception I think[2.0] The perception is probably setting in in less than a quarter of a second after you get a stroke.[2.0] It's pretty fast as well.[3.0] I mean[3.0] The identifying that is the bell. It comes really quick.[2.0] You know what that sound is, and you're just right there, look it up in your database, and there it is, Bell. But even if you didn't know what it was, you would still have the same either pleasant or unpleasant reaction to it, even before you could identify what it is. That's why I say that, like if you're walking in the woods and you see something and you can't quite tell what it is, you've got maybe a couple of seconds before you figure it out. And during that time, you can watch your mind churning away, trying to figure out what it is. But the Vedana has already happened.[2.0] And if you're really good, you can notice that, yeah, it's pleasant even though I don't know what it is. I like the color, sir.[3.0] But it's not thinking is it pleasant or unpleasant you know that without having to think about[32.0] to a sight consciousness.[18.0] Right, but the Saitvaidana is going to be the same no matter what your mind stays.[2.0] Okay, so it's just the colored shape that you see and then it's the downstream reaction after you interpret it as what it is or unable to interpret.[6.0] Okay.[2.0] Go out in the woods and see. Yeah. Yeah, for sounds, science can tell us what sounds we're going to find pleasant or unpleasant. If the ratio of the overtones is small whole numbers, we find it pleasant.[2.0] Anybody that knows music theories got introduced to this quite early. If the ratio of the overtones is not small whole numbers, we find it unpleasant.[2.0] you press two keys next to each other on the piano, the overtones don't make a nice ratio and you find it unpleasant. It's just in our ears. It works like that. It's mechanical.[2.0] But it may be that the piece of music that's being played has very pleasant association with it. And so now that you're noticing that association rather than the sounds themselves, or an unpleasant association,[2.0] And so now you're missing how nice the music actually sounds because you're downstream reaction.[3.0] back in the whatever and you know so you're now lost on something[4.0] I don't know about sites. I certainly know that blue and orange, dark blue and dark orange, don't go together. So it may be something to do with the wavelengths and how they contrast and so forth. I'm not sure. But all that mental stuff, that's very malleable. You can see the same thing in your experience of it as pleasant or unpleasant. It can change. But the site fade, I don't think changes. It's your downstream interpretation.[5.0] But, you know, don't take my word for anything I say up here. Just because I'm facing this way doesn't make me right. You've got to check all this stuff out for yourself."}

With each exhale, let go of any mental or physical tension, allowing yourself to fully relax. Spend a few minutes simply being aware of your breath, returning to it whenever your mind wanders.\n\nNext, Impermanence Reflection:\nShift your focus to the concept of impermanence - the understanding that everything in life is transient and subject to change. Begin by reflecting on the nature of life itself, noting that birth, aging, illness, and death are inevitable parts of the human experience. Acknowledge that grief arises from these changes, as we sometimes cling to what is passing away. Embrace the understanding that by accepting the cycle of life, we can find solace in the knowledge that change is an inherent part of our existence.\n\nThen, Cultivating Compassion:\nDirect your attention towards self-compassion and expanding it towards others who are also touched by grief. Recognize that grief is a shared experience, and by acknowledging our own suffering, we become more attuned to the suffering of others. As you breathe in, visualize compassion filling your being, soothing your grief and pain. As you exhale, radiate this compassion towards others, picturing it spreading outward to embrace all beings affected by loss.\n\n Letting Go and Acceptance:\nRelease any resistance or attachment to the grief you may be carrying. Accept that grieving is a natural response to loss and allowing yourself to experience it fully will aid in the healing process. Visualize yourself holding your grief gently, it being a part of you but not defining or overwhelming you. Embrace the understanding that loss is an integral part of the cycle of life, and through acceptance, you can find peace and solace.\n\n Loving-kindness Meditation:\nConclude your meditation by focusing on cultivating love and kindness for yourself and all beings. Repeat the following phrases or formulate your own, offering them with genuine intention:\n- May I be free from suffering and grief.\n- May I find acceptance and peace in the cycle of life.\n- May all beings touched by grief find comfort and solace.\n- May all beings, as they encounter loss, find strength in accepting the impermanence of life.\n\nTake a few moments to sit in stillness, allowing the essence of your practice to settle within you.
